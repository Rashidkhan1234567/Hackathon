# 🔒 Security Policy

## 📢 Reporting a Vulnerability
If you discover a security vulnerability in this project, please report it **privately** to prevent any potential exploitation. You can do so by contacting us via **[your-email@example.com]**. We appreciate responsible disclosure and will respond as soon as possible. 🚀

## 🔐 Data Protection
We take data security seriously. Here are some key measures implemented to safeguard user data:

- **Encryption:** All sensitive data is encrypted before being stored. 🛡️
- **Authentication:** Secure authentication methods like JWT tokens are used. 🔑
- **API Security:** All API endpoints are protected with proper authentication and rate limiting.
- **Environment Variables:** No sensitive data (e.g., API keys, database credentials) is exposed in the codebase.
- **CORS Policy:** Strict CORS rules are in place to prevent unauthorized access.

## 🚨 Best Practices for Developers
To ensure security best practices, developers should:

- Never hardcode credentials or sensitive information in the code.
- Use `.env` files for configuration and keep them out of version control.
- Regularly update dependencies to patch vulnerabilities.
- Validate and sanitize all user inputs to prevent **SQL Injection & XSS attacks**.
- Enable logging & monitoring for detecting suspicious activities.

## 🛠 Security Updates
We actively monitor and update dependencies to fix known vulnerabilities. If you find any security concerns, please report them immediately. 🛠️

Thank you for helping us keep this project secure! 🔥
